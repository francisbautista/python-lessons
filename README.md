# python-lessons
Series of Python notebooks for teaching and reference purposes.

Forked off [Kuleshov and Caswell](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) and modified for Python3.

It includes the following:
* Introduction to Python
* Numpy Cheatsheet
* Matplotlib Cheatsheet
* Pandas Introduction

This mainly uses Python3 with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit as accessory libraries. This notebook set is a work in progres and will be updated whenever I figure out something cool and new with the Python data science toolchain.
